# Bike-Sales
This project aims to explore and analyze the bike sales landscape in India using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). The dataset includes key attributes such as brand, model, price, year of manufacture, resale price, and geographical details. Through this analysis, we aim to uncover patterns, trends, and insights that influence bike sales and ownership in India.

This insight helps in understanding the preferred bike brands for daily commuting.
By analyzing mileage logs and user-reported data, we can identify which brands offer higher durability and fuel efficiency for long-distance travel.
Price Distribution Across Different Brands (INR)

This analysis showcases how bike prices vary across different brands.
It helps in identifying price segments (budget, mid-range, premium) and the most preferred price range among buyers.
Resale Price Distribution by Owner Type

The resale price of a bike depends on factors such as the number of previous owners, brand, and condition.
By categorizing resale prices based on first, second, or third-hand ownership, we can determine how ownership history affects a bike's resale value.
Distribution of Total Year of Manufacture by Brand

This analysis helps in understanding the production trends of different brands over the years.
It highlights whether certain brands manufacture bikes with longer lifespans and how model longevity impacts consumer preference.
Year of Manufacture Distribution by City Tier

Indian cities can be classified into different tiers (Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3) based on their population and development.
This insight helps in identifying whether newer or older bikes are more commonly sold in different city tiers.
It also indicates how economic conditions and consumer preferences vary between metropolitan cities and smaller towns.
